         What's up with you, Dunyasha...?<br>

         <b>DUNYASHA.</b><br>
          My hands are shaking. I shall faint.<br>

        <b>LOPAKHIN.</b><br> 
        You're too sensitive, Dunyasha. You dress just like a lady,
        and you do your hair like one too. You oughtn't. You should know your
        place.<br>

        <b>EPIKHODOV.</b><br>
        [Enters with a bouquet. He wears a short jacket and
         brilliantly polished boots which squeak audibly. He drops the bouquet as
         he enters, then picks it up] The gardener sent these; says they're to go
         into the dining-room. [Gives the bouquet]<br>
        
         <b>LOPAKHIN.</b><br>
          And you'll bring me some kvass.<br>
        
         <b>DUNYASHA.</b><br>
          Very well. <br>
          [Exit.]</br>

        
         <b>EPIKHODOV.</b><br>
         </b>Ermolai Alexeyevitch, allow me to say to you, in addition, that I bought
         myself some boots two days ago, and I beg to assure you that they squeak
         in a perfectly unbearable manner. What shall I put on them?<br>
